                      The Front Porch Coalition was created after an informal meeting on March 2, 2001 in Rapid City of more than 50 people who wanted to do something about the problem of suicide. Today, the Coalition is a leader locally, statewide, and nationally in a movement that is gaining momentum in preventing suicide, one community at a time, one person at a time. It is the only agency in Western South Dakota solely devoted to suicide prevention.

                    <p class="larger">
                      The Coalition’s work has been central to bringing the prevalence of suicide–the 2nd leading cause of death of people ages 15-34 and tragically the #1 leading cause of death among our young people ages 12-22. It is also the 9th leading cause of death of people all ages in South Dakota to the attention of the public, community leaders,
                      and lawmakers.

                        The Front Porch Coalition, Inc. is a private 501c3 nonprofit organization serving families and friends who have tragically lost someone to suicide through its volunteer L.O.S.S. (Local Outreach to Suicide Survivors) first response team.

                    <p class="larger">
                        We also coordinate suicide prevention, education, training, and awareness services to the community by educating people of all ages, demographic backgrounds, civic, and community groups on the incidence of suicide and how to prevent it. We serve the Black Hills communities of Western South Dakota with the L.O.S.S. Team responding with law enforcement immediately in Pennington, Meade, and Lawrence counties of the Black Hills.

                      The Coalition believes that together there is hope–and invites you to become a partner to help advance and sustain suicide prevention programs throughout the Black Hills.
