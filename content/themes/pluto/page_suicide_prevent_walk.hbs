                    <p>Suicide is <strong>Everyone’s Loss;</strong> THEREFORE, <strong>“Suicide Prevention is Everyone's Business"</strong>. While it may be difficult to talk about 'suicide', it cannot remain a taboo subject. We must remain connected to
                        everyone and help each other, even when they are suicidal.</p>

                <h4>Overcome this myth:</h4>

                <p>
                    Know that if you reach out to someone in good faith to help them, you are not liable for what may or may not happen to them because you are covered by the Good Samaritan Law. Everyone has to talk about suicide and should know how to do a suicide intervention.
                    An intervention is not counseling and by learning how to intervene on someone whose thoughts of suicide are an imminent risk, you are not providing ongoing therapy. You are intervening on someone's potential actions before they harm
                    themselves and ensuring that they are safe until they do receive mental health treatment of counseling and therapy.
