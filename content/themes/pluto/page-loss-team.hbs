                            The L.O.S.S. (Local Outreach to Suicide Survivors) Team Program has become the most vital and impactful service that the Front Porch Coalition provides to people who have lost someone to suicide. This program is an active model of postvention made up
                            of a team of trained survivors who go to the scenes of suicides to disseminate information about resources and be the installation of hope for the newly bereaved.

                            The primary goal of an Active Postvention Model (APM) that this program is based upon is to let survivors of suicide know that resources exist as soon as possible following the death while providing support and hope. Without the help that is provided
                            to people traumatized by such a tragic death, so many suicide survivors would feel alone, isolated, and succumbing to many mental health difficulties.

                            The Front Porch Coalition's L.O.S.S. Team has assisted families in getting services within two weeks of enduring their loss. Since its implementation in 2005, some of the current team members were at one time reached by this L.O.S.S. Team, a true testament
                            to the impact and success that the program has made on the lives of people who have lost someone to suicide. This L.O.S.S. Team was one of the first teams to start after Dr. Campbell's first team began. This model has now been
                            replicated in countries around the world.
